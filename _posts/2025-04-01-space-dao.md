The challenge of space exploration isn't just rocket science. It's also a governance problem. And while this might sound like science fiction, it's also a fun thought experiment about how decentralised governance could scale—literally—to the stars. Imagine a future where a consortium of investors builds a spacecraft to mine asteroids. The cost? Astronomical. And the mission? Fluid, unpredictable, and unfolding millions of kilometres from Earth. In this context, the real question becomes: who decides what the ship does after it's launched?

## The Spacefaring DAO: A 17th Century Problem in a 21st Century Context

In the 17th century, voyages to the East Indies were not micromanaged by sovereigns or distant boards. Instead, they were backed by chartered companies—semi-autonomous, self-governing entities where merchants and investors pooled capital for high-risk, high-reward expeditions. These companies didn't just fund the ships—they governed them, with delegated authority to negotiate, trade, fight, and settle far from home. The captains followed pre-agreed instructions, but once underway, they often had sweeping autonomy to adapt based on conditions.

Space mining brings us back to this kind of model—only now the "captain" is a robot. One vessel. Many stakeholders. A changing mission profile. And no real-time communication once you're out of low Earth orbit. Even the Moon brings round-trip latency. Mars? You're looking at 10+ minute delays, minimum. In asteroid belts and beyond, real-time command is simply infeasible.

So, how do you trust the instructions your autonomous ship receives? How do you coordinate policy among distributed stakeholders in a trustless, high-latency environment?

You do what the chartered companies did: embed governance into the vessel itself—only this time, not through paper charters and sealed letters, but through Ethereum smart contracts and DAOs.

## The Traditional Approach: Command, Control, and Centralised Risk

In today's model of space missions, a centralised Mission Control acts as the ultimate authority. Spacecraft are equipped with onboard systems, but significant decisions are routed through Earth. Engineers monitor telemetry, analyse conditions, and send commands based on evolving scenarios.

The model works well when you trust a single entity e.g. NASA. But what happens when a private consortium backs the mission? Who gets to speak for the vessel when Earth-bound interests diverge? What if one actor wants to change course mid-mission, while another doesn't?

This is where the centralised model frays. The complexities of interplanetary commerce require a new kind of governance, one that can operate autonomously, transparently, and without reliance on a single ground control.

## Ethereum as the Interplanetary Command Layer

Ethereum offers a compelling substrate to coordinate such missions, and its trust model and programmability are uniquely suited to the problem.

A DAO could be created to coordinate the asteroid mining mission, with tokenised governance representing the interests of stakeholders: investors, engineers, scientists, and even future space workers. The DAO can:

- Predefine mission logic encoded in smart contracts (e.g. `divert to asteroid B if asteroid A is depleted`).
- Execute upgrades via on-chain proposals and votes, weighted by stake or reputation.
- Authorise transactions, such as payload deployment, docking with other vessels, or accepting third-party service offers.
- Distribute rewards based on verified proof of work (`the mining kind, not the blockchain kind`).

The core idea is this: rather than rely on central mission control, the vessel becomes a self-sovereign node in a decentralised decision-making process. Governance occurs on Ethereum, but the execution can happen anywhere onboard the ship, in orbit, or in off-chain systems that sync via cryptographic proofs.

## Handling Latency, Trust, and Change

One of the most novel aspects of using Ethereum for interplanetary consensus is asynchronous trust.

We can't avoid latency. But we can mitigate mistrust. Decisions can be made in advance by the DAO, then signed and cached on-chain. These decisions can be synced to the vessel, verified using light clients or zk-proofs, and executed autonomously.

But space is unpredictable. Missions evolve. A new asteroid might be discovered. An engine may fail. The DAO must remain agile.

In this way, the DAO becomes a living, evolving agreement always grounded in the shared trust of a transparent, immutable ledger.

## Ethereum’s Role in the Cosmic Commons

Ethereum’s philosophy has always leaned toward credible neutrality, permissionless innovation, and shared infrastructure. What better application of this ethos than the governance of shared human endeavours in space?

In many ways, DAOs are the modern version of the chartered company. Programmable, borderless, and natively digital. If we're serious about becoming an interplanetary species, we need more than rockets. We need trust-minimised systems of coordination.

## Final Thought

Ethereum offers the closest thing we have to a global, neutral, censorship-resistant layer for coordinating diverse actors in a high-stakes, high-latency environment.

In the age of sail, we launched ships powered by wind and guided by compass and charter. In the age of space, we'll launch vessels powered by ion thrusters and guided by cryptographic proofs.
