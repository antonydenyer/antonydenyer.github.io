Last Thursday a few of us from 7digital had a meet up with [Sebastien Lambla ][1]author of [OpenRasta][2].
As some of you may know we're been writing all our new API endpoint using [OpenRasta][2], we have a vested interested in ensuring the success of this project and as such are responding to the rallying cry with gusto.

So what's going to happen? Essentially [7digital][3], along with [Huddle][4] and [Neil Mosafi][5], will jumping on board to help out with development and maintenance of OpenRasta 2.x. Short term goals are to help people get started with [OpenRasta][2]. At the moment it's not particularly easy to get going with the 2.1 code. The first thing to get up and running with is a build server, this is something that 7digital will be taking responsibility for. Our first aim is to build [OpenRasta][2] and publish _latest binaries with every push and make those binaries available in [OpenWrap][6], [NuGet][7] and as binary downloads.

We're really looking forward to working with everyone on [OpenRasta][2] and can't wait to get stuck in.
