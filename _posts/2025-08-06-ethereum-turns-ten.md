In the early days of Ethereum, everything was up for grabs. The idea that a global computer could run trustless applications in an adversarial environment was so radical that no one pretended to have it figured out. The very act of deploying a smart contract felt like something that could blow your leg off. There were no best practices, few standards, and fewer constraints. And it was the magical.

### But now, as Ethereum turns ten, we risk losing that spark.

Today, Ethereum is mature. It has become infrastructure. The network secures hundreds of billions in value. It hosts complex financial protocols, DAOs, rollups, and identity primitives. Ethereum has survived forks, wars, regulatory attention, and existential bugs. We've built things that last. We've learned from failure. We've built client diversity, formal verification, and rollup-centric scaling. But sadly, many people think they know what they're doing.

As a creative person, if you think you know what you're doing, you're in trouble - from researchers to developers, we should all remain impertinent. Once you fall into the trap of thinking you know what you're doing, you stop looking around for alternatives. You stop seeing the weird, marginal, paradigm-shifting ideas. You become the person who scoffed at Bitcoin for having no intrinsic value, the engineer who couldn't see why anybody would approach things differently. You become ossified. 

The Ethereum community has spent the last decade pioneering new ideas: gas markets, on-chain DAOs, NFTs, zero-knowledge proofs, and retroactive public goods funding. Many of these have been great, while others have been terrible. But the more these ideas succeed, the bigger Ethereum becomes, the easier it is to fall into the trap of assuming the current paradigms are the only paradigms. That rollups are the only way to scale, the EVM is the only execution environment, that MEV is a problem to be minimised, rather than a design space to be reimagined.

In short, we're in danger of epistemic closure where only ideas from high priests are accepted. The roadmap becomes a holy text. 

Because the history of computing is not a linear march from worse to better, it's a forest of ideas, most of which wither not because they were flawed, but because the dominant narrative couldn't see them. The Ethereum community has always been intellectually curious, philosophically grounded, and radically open to experimentation. But those values must be continually re-earned.

### We need to remain suspicious of orthodoxy, even our own.

This isn't a call to abandon standards or to throw caution to the wind. Ethereum must be secure, stable, and reliable. But it must also remain fertile ground for weirdness. That means continuing to ask absurd, impertinent questions.

Ethereum thrives not because we know what we're doing, but because we're willing to admit we don't. That humility is what made it possible to imagine the impossible. It's what lets us see around corners.

Progress often demands a level of arrogance to question the frame itself. To be impertinent in the face of established wisdom. If we want to remain open to radical innovation, we have to keep that impertinence alive.

So, as Ethereum turns ten, the most important thing we can say is:

# We still don't know what we're doing.

Not as a dismissal of our progress, but as a commitment to keep looking. To stay weird. To stay open. To keep reinventing the very thing we think we've built.

Because that - more than any upgrade, roadmap, or narrative - is what makes Ethereum truly unstoppable.
