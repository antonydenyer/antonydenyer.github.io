In software development, **inversion of control (IoC)** has been one of the most transformative architectural shifts for building loosely coupled, extensible software solutions. Instead of developers controlling the full execution flow, the **framework orchestrates**, and the developer plugs in local behaviour. This pattern shows up in dependency injection, event-driven programming, and plugin architectures and it's the foundation of how modern software scales.

With **EIP-7702 now live on Ethereum mainnet**, the same idea is now available for EOA accounts. EOAs can temporarily inject custom logic into their transactions, effectively making accounts *plugins of the Ethereum framework*. To understand its significance, it's worth drawing explicit parallels to IoC patterns in conventional software and then tying it back to what today's wallet infrastructure is already doing.

## IoC in Software: A Few Key Patterns

1. **Event-driven programming (UI frameworks, Node.js)**  
   - You don't write the main loop. The framework does.  
   - You simply register callbacks: `onClick()`, `onSubmit()`, etc.  
   - The framework decides *when* and *how often* they run.  

2. **Dependency injection (Spring, .NET)**  
   - Instead of constructing dependencies, you declare what you need.  
   - A container provides them at runtime.  
   - The framework controls object lifecycles; you only specify behaviour.  

3. **Plugin architectures (VS Code, WordPress, Chrome extensions)**  
   - The host system defines extension points.  
   - Third parties inject their logic into those hooks.  
   - The framework enforces boundaries so extensions don't break the core.  

Each of these is IoC in practice: the framework owns the control flow, developers own the custom logic.

## IoC on Ethereum: What 7702 Enables

Ethereum EOAs have historically been rigid. Wallets show a confirmation, it gets signed and submitted, then executed. No hooks, no flexibility.

With 7702, the control flips:  
- The EOA still signs a transaction, but it can delegate validation to custom logic. For example, allowing a smart contract to accept other signatures or enforce spending rules.  
- The contract can attach arbitrary logic that decides this.  
- For the duration of the transaction, the account becomes a mini-framework: it can define its own validation rules, authorisation logic, or spending policies.  
- For example, you could delegate your wallet to a smart contract that automatically rebalances your portfolio to maintain a 60/40 WETH/WBTC split.  

This is IoC in action: Ethereum provides the execution environment; the smart contract supplies the behaviour.

## Real-World Parallels in Wallets and Infra

The demand for this inversion of control has been clear for years 7702 simply makes it native.

- **Embedded wallets (Privy, Web3Auth, Dynamic)**  
 Abstract away key management with OAuth or MPC. Previously required relayers or smart contract wallets; now they can declare their flow natively per transaction.

- **MetaMask Delegation Toolkit**  
 Delegation is IoC in practice: instead of the user signing everything, they grant limited rights (spending caps, session keys). With 7702, these rules run directly at the account level. Ironically, MetaMask's own wallet client still doesn't let you sign a delegation authorisation or send a type-4 transaction the very primitives their toolkit depends on.

- **OneBalance Toolkit**  
 OneBalance has rolled out **7702 support** in its developer toolkit. It provides composable balance logic, including programmable spending rules, delegation, and transaction policies. In IoC terms, OneBalance is essentially providing "account plugins" for wallets and tokens.

- **Biconomy Super Transactions**  
 Gas abstraction and batching invert control from "users must pay directly" to "apps define payment logic." With 7702, accounts themselves can enforce this logic in a single native transaction.

These systems were IoC workarounds. Now, with 7702 live, they can anchor themselves in the protocol.  

## 7702 vs ERC-4337: Framework vs Container

- **ERC-4337** behaves like a heavyweight IoC container (e.g. Spring).  
  - Manages lifecycle through persistent contract wallets.  
  - Relies on bundlers and paymasters, akin to service containers.  
  - Best for complex, durable account logic.  

- **EIP-7702** is closer to lightweight event hooks.  
  - Just-in-time injection of logic.  
  - No intermediaries required.  
  - Perfect for experimentation and extensions.

Both coexist in the software world and now on Ethereum too.

## What IoC Brings (and Ethereum Now Has)

History doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes, so what can we expect?

1. **Exploding ecosystems**: shared libraries and plugins of account logic.  
2. **Rapid prototyping**: new wallet behaviours without protocol changes.  
3. **Specialisation**: protocol stays simple; innovation moves to the edges.  
4. **New attack surfaces**: malicious logic injection, confusing execution flows.  

Already, we're starting to see libraries of account modules emerge daily spend limits, social recovery, and delegation schemes.

## Ethereum as a Framework

Ethereum has always aimed to be a neutral base layer. With 7702, it feels less like a rigid ledger and more like a **framework for accounts** to leverage.  

Like a UI toolkit that lets developers register callbacks, Ethereum now lets accounts define their own hooks. The protocol orchestrates, but users supply the rules.

## Conclusions

Now that 7702 is live, the conversation shifts from "what could this enable?" to "how do we manage it responsibly?"  

- What excites me: 7702 unifies fragmented wallet experiments under a clean, native model. We can expect faster iteration, cleaner developer experience, and more flexible UX.  
- What frustrates me: leading wallets still don't expose type-4 transactions or delegation signing to end users. Forcing them to use workarounds even though the protocol supports it. This is like a browser supporting service workers under the hood but refusing to let sites register them.  
- What concerns me: IoC always breeds opacity. Users must be able to see what logic is running on their accounts. Otherwise, phishing and "logic injection" attacks will proliferate.  

I'll be watching for:  
- Wallet UIs that surface ephemeral logic clearly.  
- Ecosystem-standard "account plugins" that are audited and reusable.  
- How 7702 balances simplicity with the complexity that inevitably grows at the edges.  

EIP-7702 marks a turning point. Ethereum accounts are no longer fixed-function actors. They're becoming programmable participants in the network and inversion of control is the key idea making that possible.
